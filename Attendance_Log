**2022-01-01 - 2022-04-23:**
I am taking the Edx courses offered by Georgia Tech in conjuction with their Masters of Computer Science program. 

Course name: Introduction to Python Programming, using the same material as CS1301: Introduction to Computing at Georgia Tech.

**2022-04-24: **

**Topic:** Edx course -> Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I: Foundations and Syntax Basics
**Purpose:** I know Python but I am preparing for the other Edx course I will be taking on Data Structures and Algortithms which is taught in Java.
This course also teaches OOP in Java.
**What did you do?** Downloaded and set up Eclipse IDE, completed HW01 on Java basics. Check the "CS1331" file and look for HW01 for my coding solutions.


**2022-05-01:**

**Topic:** 
I completed and uploaded my Calculator.java application and uploaded it to GitHub. 

**Purpose:** 
To apply Java for one the first time. So far I have been implementing code and sorting algorithms in Python but have not built any applications in Java yet.
This is my first time applying the Java syntax and OOP principles in any application.

**What did you do?**
It is a basic calculator application that adds,subtracts, 
multiplies, divides, and alphabetizes strings. It takes two integers or strings separated by a space in one line of input on the terminal. 
It demonstrates usage of a switch statement, Scanner and next for user input, parsing user input into workable data types (string to int), and the comparable class on strings.

**2022-05-08:**
**Topic:** Battleship Application Progress
**Purpose:** 
To recreate the classic game battleship where user place their ships on a grid board and then fire at their opponents to sink all their battleships.
**What did you do?** 

So far I have set up the game so players can place their five 1-unit long ships onto their 5x5 gridfield. Scanner takes in two integers seperated by a space as the coordinates of each ship.
I also have prototyped my "turn" method where players pick a coordinate to shoot at and then it updates the "Location" board (did my ship get hit?) and the "Target" board for the other player to know 
where they have fired, and whether they have hit or missed. The boards then print to the console/terminal/whatever it is called with 20 lines between each board to prevent screen peaking. I am currently
debugging this turn method because my return function is only printing the place in memory where the Location and Target board arrays are stored rather than the actual boards themselves.
