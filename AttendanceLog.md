# Attendance
I self study every day for a minimum of 2 hours. This is a log to keep a record of the hours and work.

I am studying my Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology with a specialization in Machine Learning. 

Not all of my work results in projects that I can list on a portfolio but this can at least log my efforts. My background is in mathematics (Bachelors degree) so this log is important while I self-study computer science on the side in conjunction with my Georgia Tech classes.

The goal is to use this to get a software devleopment or data analyst position so I can upskill while I am getting paid do it. I am transitioning from a career as a tenured teacher.

**Topic:** 
CS7637: Knowledge-Based Artifical Intelligence, Applying for data analyst/scientist/Machine Learning internships
**Purpose:**
To introduce myself to more rigorous coursework and apply my OOP knowledge to projects, to get real-world experience working on a team.
**What did you do?**
I wasn't quite ready yet but I really wanted to try out another high level programming class. I learned so much from the Artifical Intelligence for Robotics class that I figured it would be a great opportunity to apply my new programming skills. I made it through the first ~6 weeks but ended up falling behind and needed to withdraw. I talked to many smart people in class and learned which data structures and algorithms are most important such as trees, graphs, BFS, and DFS. It was a great trial by fire and I learned what I am now regarding as the most imporant thing yet; I NEED TO GET A JOB IN THE FIELD. Everyone else has on the job experience which I need. Self-study is not enough and I need to eat, sleep, and breathe data science. I've updated my resume for tech and have formatted my teaching experience in a relevant manner to the data science field. I gathered a list of 40 internships/jobs and narrowed it down to 20 to start applying to. My next update will be on which companies I am applying to.

**Topic:** 
CS6750 Class conclusion (Grade = A), Vet Assignment and its poor instructions (Object Oriented Programming Java)

**Purpose:**
To get my masters in computer science, learn more OOP building off concepts in the Amidst Us project and introduce exceptions including try/catch blocks, unhandled exceptions, and FilenotfoundExceptions, IOExceptions. I also practiced reading and writing files.

**What did you do?**
I completed my CS6750: Human computer Interaction course at GA Tech. The SEIS project is complete which I may upload a copy of here. I actually just took a new career position where I work with 9 different types of SEIS systems. These systems actually show that many of the issues I outlined in my project do not apply to other SEIS logins. I will probably need to update the paper now; however, you can see my writing skills and how I can communicate in that paper. Be easy on me because it is pretty much the second research paper I have ever written! I took the final and got an A. Overall, my grade in the course was an A. The next GA Tech course I will be taking is Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence where it looks like I get to code an AI that passes human intelligence tests (Raven's Matrices). This course gives the option of Java or Python. I will be using Python for the course. This will be interesting because my OOP courses I am doing on my own time are all in Java.

### Vet Assignment
The vet assignment made me apply new concepts I learned in my Java OOP class. I applied more inheritance and polymorphism concepts including super classes and super methods. In addition, there are try and catch blocks and unhandled exceptions. One MAJOR issue: the instructions are written improperly. This really confused me. I gave it two to three days and decided to move onto the next project. Good thing I chose to spend those days becauase I did learn about how to read in .txt and .csv files with the scanner and bufferedreader classes. I also learned how the exceptions work and applied them. I ended up not finishing the project because the instructions are too convoluted. I will post what I have from the project and the instructions for others to judge, but I am pretty sure I am correct that the instructions for the Clinic class are unacceptable. I will now be moving onto the next project which is the LinkedList project. I am excited for this because it is the intro to the Data Structures an Algorithms course I am taking next!

**2022-07-03** 

**Topic:** CS6750 Project Update and status, Amidst Us project complete (Object Oriented Programming Java assignment)

**Purpose:** To describe my status in the course and interest level, Demonstrate Java proficiency with OOP superclasses and subclasses, implementing interfaces, etc.

**What did you do?**

This past week I got all the survey results I need for Cs6750. I have an A in the class and it appears that it will remain that way if I stay diligent. The problem is I have lost interest in the course. I feel like I have gotten most of what I am going to get out of it and the course has no programming. I took it because it is "easy" and I need to pass two foundational courses by January to stay in the OMSCS program.

##The Among Us spinoff assignment is finally complete!

The majority of the skills are demonstrated in the RedAstronaut and BlueAstronaut files. The Gameplay file is the driver and is where the code is tested. Use the instructions file to check if the answers in Gameplay are correct (they are). 

## Skills Demonstrated
1. Object Oriented Programming in Java: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
2. Superclass (abstract parent) and subclasses (concrete child) extentions implememented.
3. Super keyword: Constructors, and methods. @Override implemented.
4. Abstract class (parent) and abstract methods implemented concretely in child classes. Parent class methods referenced and utilized.
5. Interfaces implemented in two classes.
6. Java Arrays: Array reconstruction, appending, removing, indexing, filtering an array based on a variable.
7. Private variables used with getters and setters for encapsulation and security. 
8. Problem solving skills and programming fluency demonstrated with loops, conditionals, counts, array indexing manipulation, and print statements.
9. Driver file to run tests and simulate Amidst Us gameplay.

### Disclaimer: Deliberately dirty code to show thought processes and aid me in learning. Cleaner version can be created later.

**Topic:** CS6750 Survey update and partial results, CS6750 Midterm Results, AmidstUs Java Object Oriented Programming

**Purpose:** To gather data for my CS6750 final project, go over my midterm results, and learn OOP.

**What did you do?**
I created a survey for the SEIS interface and sent it out to my coworkers. I feel really good about this survey because I think I did a good job. It asnwers all the questions from the data inventory about users of the interface and the data from the survey automatically populates the fields in my excel file for each question. So far 2 days after launching the survey I have 10 responses. I plan to use this project as a possible future employment opporutnity with SEIS since it relates to the industry I currently work in. 

I scored 132/150 on the Midterm putting me firmly in the top half of the class. Pretty excited about that! It tested everything I learned from the first 6 weeks in a 2 hour testing session. 

The AmidstUs project is a spin off of the AmongUs game popular on mobile devices. It involves the use of inheritance, the keyword super to create super constructors in the child class that are based off the parent class, and implementing interfaces with abstract methods. This is the toughest project I have done so far and feel like this is a turning point in terms of the complexity of OOP that I understand. Depending on well I contintue to perform on these side projects will determine if I think I am ready for a programming class in January 2023 or if I need to use that semester to self-study. The class I plan to take in January 2023 is Software Development Process or SDP for short. This is a course that uses Java to build team projects and will hopefully be a good jumping off point for my job search that I plan to begin spring 2023.

**Topic:** CS6750 Survey and Midterm, Pond Project, New Laptop
**Purpose:** Designing project survey, planning out Pond Project, 
**What did you do?** This week I need to create another survey for my class. This is for my class project and it will be to redesing the SEIS interface that I use for my current work. I have access to many people that use the same system through the work email so this works great! The results of this survey will give me quantitative data on what parts of the redesign are most important. 

The plan for the pond project is to spend at least an hour a day on it. I am busy with my course assignments, exams, and projects this week so I may need to increase my total computer time from 4 to 5 hours.

My laptop retails for about $1500. I found it open box at a Best Buy an hour from my house selling for $890. After tax, I paid a little under a thousand dollars. The specs are AMD Ryzen 5000 series 9 processor, a Nvidia Geforce RTX 3060 GPU, 1 TB SSD, and 16gb ram. I have not used AMD before but the CPU is powerful from what I understand. The GPU is this current generation. Overall, I thought this was a great deal. The laptop has a smaller display and is light weight which I prefer because I travel frequently.

**Topic:** CS6750 Update,Pond Project is Back!
**Purpose:** Evaluating my needfinding techniques, summarizing my naturalistic observation, interview, and survey data.
**What did you do?**
I administered a naturalistic observation, interview and 25 respondent survey. The project is redesigning the internet browser on the Amazon Firestick. Then I analyzed the data and discovered typing was the number one issue people have with using the Amazon Silk internet browser on the Firestick. Over 60% of respondents that disagree with the statement "The internet browser is easy to use on this device" indicated it was because of the typing feature. 


Then respondents were asked to “select all that are true about the internet browser.” 84% of the respondents selected “It takes much longer to find what I am looking for using the internet browser on the media device(Firestick, Roku, Chromecast, etc), than on a phone or computer.” Users performing internet searches on their phone could cause them to be distracted from using the Amazon Firestick and reducing time spent on the Firestick overall. Possible benefits of improving the user interface of the Amazon Silk internet browser include increased user time on the Amazon Firestick leading to revenue increases.

Summer is here and I will be dedicating 4 hours a day to computer science. Some of that time will be on the Pond project to increase my Object Oriented Programming Skills. Also, the Battleship game is now available in this repository in my GitHub! https://github.com/CodesterEvans/Battleship_Game

**Georgia Tech CS6750:HCI, Pond Project delays, laptop trouble update:** 
**Purpose:** Masters degree in CompSci and learn UI UX design principles through projects, learn OOP, and have a working laptop.
**What did you do?**
The GA Tech class has taken more time than originally projected and my pond project has been stalled for about a week and a half now. It is dissapointing because I would much rather learn Object Oriented Programming through the Pond Project. I created fly objects to interact with frog objects via methods such as eat. 
In HCI class I have learned more about what to program, rather than how to program. I planned out my project for the next few weeks and designed a 10 quesiton survey using non-biased questions per the design principles we learned. We are reading papers by Mckenzie and Norman.
The broken laptop is just about done with. I replaced the battery but that did not fix the problem. The suspicion is it is the charging port; however, the whole motherboard will need to be taken off. It appears I need to remove the old port and sauter a new one on or at least tape the port. I also learned more about the GPU and it is an old 940m GPU. It appears there have been at least 3 new Nvidia generations of GPUs created since I bought this laptop. I have decided to buy a new laptop with a 30 series GPU and i9 CPU. I am still deciding on which specific laptop to purchase.

**Topic:** Starting new Georgia Tech Class, Pond Project, and laptop troubles update.
**Purpose:** To get a masters degree in computer science, Practice OOP with multiple java files in unision, and fix my laptop!
**What did you do?**
This week I started my summer course, CS6750: Human-Computer Interactions. This course will go over how to create a better user interface and experience with technical design methods. This week we discussed the processor model, predictor model, and participant model. Also covered were feedback processes called the "gulf of execution" and the "gulf of evaluation" which detail the difficulty of using an interface and the user interpretation of feedback after they take an action. The Pond project is the next homework assignment in my side course on object oriented programming. I need to make three java files, one for "Fly","Frog", and "Pond". The frog file needs variables and methods that allow it to gain mass, age, speed,etc for eating flies. Flies have their own methods for growing and gaining/losing stats. The pond is the environment for both the frog and flies to live in. So far one of the main skills utilized is accessing private variables from one java file such as "Fly" using methods of the Fly class. These private mass and speed variables determine if the frog is quick enough to catch the fly, and if the fly is massive enough to make the frog grow significantly. Flies can increase their stats by avoiding frogs.

**Topic:**  Battelship Application Completed and my high powered laptop computer stops charging and won't turn on!
**Purpose:** To recreate the classic game battleship where users place their ships on a grid board and then fire at their opponents to sink all their battleships.
**What did you do?** 
I completed the battleship application which can be viewed in a separate repositiory. This involved the use of switch statements for input validation, along with plenty of data type conversions such as str->int, a nested do-while loop to count the remaining number of ships represented by the '@' character in a multi-dimensional char[][] array, use of the split function to split a string into an array that will be used as the location board for ships as well as the target tracking board to keep track of user hits and misses on the 5 x 5 playing grid. The highest dimenisional array used here was a 3 dimensional char array used to store both plaAyers' game boards where '@' is a ship that has not been hit, '-' is a space that has not been fired upon yet, 'O' is a space where the user has shot but missed, and 'X' is a spot where the user has hit. The game terminates after the program detects that one of the users has no ships left and prints to the terminal that the game is over and which specific player has won the game!

My gaming laptop with good specs stopped charging this week and my Georgia Tech class begins on Monday! A new laptop would cost me about $1500 for the one that will get me through the machine learning classes at GA Tech. 
Instead of shelling out the $1500, I researched the model number using a variety of sources but none showed my laptop or its battery type. I called the computer repair shop and they could not find the battery either. The technician said they will need to open up the computer to figure out what the battery is and quoted me $150. I decided to buy a $10 mini scredriver kit and I opened the laptop up myself. It was very easy and I am surprised I have never opened up a laptop before. I ordered the battery for $35 and it will be here by the end of the next week. Wish me luck with the repair!

**Topic:** Battleship Application Progress
**Purpose:** 
To recreate the classic game battleship where users place their ships on a grid board and then fire at their opponents to sink all their battleships.
**What did you do?** 

So far I have set up the game so players can place their five 1-unit long ships onto their 5x5 gridfield. Scanner takes in two integers seperated by a space as the coordinates of each ship.
I also have prototyped my "turn" method where players pick a coordinate to shoot at and then it updates the "Location" board (did my ship get hit?) and the "Target" board for the other player to know 
where they have fired, and whether they have hit or missed. The boards then print to the terminal with 20 lines between each board to prevent screen peaking. 
I am currently debugging this turn method because my return function is only printing the place in memory where the Location and Target board arrays are stored rather than the actual boards themselves.

**Topic:** 
I completed and uploaded my Calculator.java application and uploaded it to GitHub. 

**Purpose:** 
To apply Java for the first time. So far I have been implementing code and sorting algorithms in Python but have not built any applications in Java yet.
This is my first time applying the Java syntax and OOP principles in any application.

**What did you do?**
It is a basic calculator application that adds,subtracts, 
multiplies, divides, and alphabetizes strings. It takes two integers or strings separated by a space in one line of input on the terminal. 
It demonstrates usage of a switch statement, Scanner and next for user input, parsing user input into workable data types (string to int), and the comparable class on strings.
