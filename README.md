# Attendance
I self study every day for a minimum of 2 hours. This is a log to keep a record of the hours and work.

I am studying my Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology with a specialization in Machine Learning. 

Not all of my work results in projects that I can list on a portfolio but this can at least log my efforts. My background is in mathematics (Bachelors degree) so this log is important while I self-study computer science on the side in conjunction with my Georgia Tech classes.

The goal is to use this to get a software devleopment or data analyst position so I can upskill while I am getting paid do it. I am transitioning from a career as a tenured teacher.

**Georgia Tech CS6750:HCI, Pond Project delays, laptop trouble update:** 
**Purpose:** Masters degree in CompSci and learn UI UX design principles through projects, learn OOP, and have a working laptop.
**What did you do?**
The GA Tech class has taken more time than originally projected and my pond project has been stalled for about a week and a half now. It is dissapointing because I would much rather learn Object Oriented Programming through the Pond Project. I created fly objects to interact with frog objects via methods such as eat. 
In HCI class I have learned more about what to program, rather than how to program. I planned out my project for the next few weeks and designed a 10 quesiton survey using non-biased questions per the design principles we learned. We are reading papers by Mckenzie and Norman.
The broken laptop is just about done with. I replaced the battery but that did not fix the problem. The suspicion is it is the charging port; however, the whole motherboard will need to be taken off. It appears I need to remove the old port and sauter a new one on or at least tape the port. I also learned more about the GPU and it is an old 940m GPU. It appears there have been at least 3 new Nvidia generations of GPUs created since I bought this laptop. I have decided to buy a new laptop with a 30 series GPU and i9 CPU. I am still deciding on which specific laptop to purchase.

**Topic:** Starting new Georgia Tech Class, Pond Project, and laptop troubles update.
**Purpose:** To get a masters degree in computer science, Practice OOP with multiple java files in unision, and fix my laptop!
**What did you do?**
This week I started my summer course, CS6750: Human-Computer Interactions. This course will go over how to create a better user interface and experience with technical design methods. This week we discussed the processor model, predictor model, and participant model. Also covered were feedback processes called the "gulf of execution" and the "gulf of evaluation" which detail the difficulty of using an interface and the user interpretation of feedback after they take an action. The Pond project is the next homework assignment in my side course on object oriented programming. I need to make three java files, one for "Fly","Frog", and "Pond". The frog file needs variables and methods that allow it to gain mass, age, speed,etc for eating flies. Flies have their own methods for growing and gaining/losing stats. The pond is the environment for both the frog and flies to live in. So far one of the main skills utilized is accessing private variables from one java file such as "Fly" using methods of the Fly class. These private mass and speed variables determine if the frog is quick enough to catch the fly, and if the fly is massive enough to make the frog grow significantly. Flies can increase their stats by avoiding frogs.

**Topic:**  Battelship Application Completed and my high powered laptop computer stops charging and won't turn on!
**Purpose:** To recreate the classic game battleship where users place their ships on a grid board and then fire at their opponents to sink all their battleships.
**What did you do?** 
I completed the battleship application which can be viewed in a separate repositiory. This involved the use of switch statements for input validation, along with plenty of data type conversions such as str->int, a nested do-while loop to count the remaining number of ships represented by the '@' character in a multi-dimensional char[][] array, use of the split function to split a string into an array that will be used as the location board for ships as well as the target tracking board to keep track of user hits and misses on the 5 x 5 playing grid. The highest dimenisional array used here was a 3 dimensional char array used to store both plaAyers' game boards where '@' is a ship that has not been hit, '-' is a space that has not been fired upon yet, 'O' is a space where the user has shot but missed, and 'X' is a spot where the user has hit. The game terminates after the program detects that one of the users has no ships left and prints to the terminal that the game is over and which specific player has won the game!

My gaming laptop with good specs stopped charging this week and my Georgia Tech class begins on Monday! A new laptop would cost me about $1500 for the one that will get me through the machine learning classes at GA Tech. 
Instead of shelling out the $1500, I researched the model number using a variety of sources but none showed my laptop or its battery type. I called the computer repair shop and they could not find the battery either. The technician said they will need to open up the computer to figure out what the battery is and quoted me $150. I decided to buy a $10 mini scredriver kit and I opened the laptop up myself. It was very easy and I am surprised I have never opened up a laptop before. I ordered the battery for $35 and it will be here by the end of the next week. Wish me luck with the repair!

**Topic:** Battleship Application Progress
**Purpose:** 
To recreate the classic game battleship where users place their ships on a grid board and then fire at their opponents to sink all their battleships.
**What did you do?** 

So far I have set up the game so players can place their five 1-unit long ships onto their 5x5 gridfield. Scanner takes in two integers seperated by a space as the coordinates of each ship.
I also have prototyped my "turn" method where players pick a coordinate to shoot at and then it updates the "Location" board (did my ship get hit?) and the "Target" board for the other player to know 
where they have fired, and whether they have hit or missed. The boards then print to the terminal with 20 lines between each board to prevent screen peaking. 
I am currently debugging this turn method because my return function is only printing the place in memory where the Location and Target board arrays are stored rather than the actual boards themselves.

**Topic:** 
I completed and uploaded my Calculator.java application and uploaded it to GitHub. 

**Purpose:** 
To apply Java for the first time. So far I have been implementing code and sorting algorithms in Python but have not built any applications in Java yet.
This is my first time applying the Java syntax and OOP principles in any application.

**What did you do?**
It is a basic calculator application that adds,subtracts, 
multiplies, divides, and alphabetizes strings. It takes two integers or strings separated by a space in one line of input on the terminal. 
It demonstrates usage of a switch statement, Scanner and next for user input, parsing user input into workable data types (string to int), and the comparable class on strings.

**Topic:** Edx course -> Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java I: Foundations and Syntax Basics
**Purpose:** I know Python but I am preparing for the other Edx course I will be taking on Data Structures and Algortithms which is taught in Java.
This course also teaches OOP in Java.
**What did you do?** 
Downloaded and set up Eclipse IDE, completed HW01 on Java basics. Check the "CS1331" file and look for HW01 for my coding solutions.


**2022-01-01 - 2022-04-23:**
This date ranges over 4 months because it is the first entry. I have been 
I am taking the Edx courses offered by Georgia Tech in conjuction with their Masters of Computer Science program. 

Course name: Introduction to Python Programming, using the same material as CS1301: Introduction to Computing at Georgia Tech.
