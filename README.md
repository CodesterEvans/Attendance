# Attendance
I self study every day for a minimum of 2 hours. This is a log to keep a record of the hours and work.

I am studying my Masters of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology with a specialization in Machine Learning. 

Not all of my work results in projects that I can list on a portfolio but this can at least log my efforts. My background is in mathematics (Bachelors degree) so this log is important while I self-study computer science on the side in conjunction with my Georgia Tech classes.

The goal is to use this to get a software devleopment or data analyst position so I can upskill while I am getting paid do it. I am transitioning from a teaching career.
